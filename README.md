## cynvee-simple-splash

This is a Neovim plugin that shows a simple splash notification using vim.notify() function.

### Installation
#### Installing with lazy.nvim
```lua
{
    "Cyncrovee/cynvee-simple-splash",
    opts = {
        -- Put the splash text you want here!
        -- For example:
        "Welcome to Neovim!",
        "Splash Text!",
        "Like Vim, but different!"
    }
}
```
Once the plugin is installed and the opts are set, thats it! The plugin should work from there.
